1. What is a digital image?
	An image, which has been produced by transforming a picture into something
	which can be processed and represented by a computer.
2. What does the paradigm “bottom-up processing” mean?
	You perceive the individual parts of an image and 
	construct an object by linking evidence from the properties of the image.
	That means you move from an low to a high processing level.
3. State at least three fundamentally different image sources!
	Optical: 
		According to the principle of a pinhole camera, an optical image source reflexts light 
		from it´s environment which can be captured by a optical sensor.
		Nowadays a typically sensor offers a color filter, which filter every lightwaves 
		except yellow, or cyan to meassure the different colors.
	Infra-red: 
		A infra-red source reflect infrared light, which a human eye can´t see, but a unique camera
		can meassure. This camera can´t meassure the temperature of an object, but you can calculate
		the heat with the Stefan-Boltzmann-Law. You can colorate the developed picture to 
		identify patterns who describes objects.
	Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR):
		SAR is a sidelooking radar system, which is been used by moving platforms to perceive the 
		surface of areas and objects. In a couple of circles, it stores data about magnitude and 
		phase from a received signal. Then it combines the data from the diverent signals to simulate 
		a much larger antenna.
